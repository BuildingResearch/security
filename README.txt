# You Make Me Tremble: A First look at Attacks Against Structural Control Systems

This repository contains the files required to simulate the attacks against structural control systems. It also contains Matlab/Simulink files required to run the experiments with the Quanser system. Each folder contains the specific files needed for every testbed. Up to now, we have only uploaded the files to run the experiment in the Quanser system. We will update all the files once the paper is accepted.

Requirements
=====

It is required Matlab 2021A to run simulations.
